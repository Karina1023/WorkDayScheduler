WORK DAY SCHEDULER

I created an application that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML, and CSS powered by JQuery.

The work day scheduler allows users to save events for each hour of the day. Each timeblock is color coordinated to show whether it is past present or future. When the save button is clicked, the information for that day is saved in local storage.
